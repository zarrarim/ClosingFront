[zarrarim.github.io](https://zarrarim.github.io/) is an online real-time strategy game focused on territorial control and alliance building. Players compete to expand their territory, build structures, and form strategic alliances in various maps based on real-world geography.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Strategy Gameplay**: Expand your territory and engage in strategic battles
- **Alliance System**: Form alliances with other players for mutual defense
- **Multiple Maps**: Play across various geographical regions including Europe, Asia, Africa, and more
- **Resource Management**: Balance your expansion with defensive capabilities
- **Cross-platform**: Play in any modern web browser

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10.9.2 or higher)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openfrontio/OpenFrontIO.git
   cd OpenFrontIO
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run inst
   ```

   Do NOT use `npm install` nor `npm i` but instead use our `npm run inst`. It runs the safer `npm ci --ignore-scripts` to install dependencies exactly according to the versions in `package-lock.json` and doesn't run scripts. This can prevent being hit by a supply chain attack.

## 🎮 Running the Game

### Development Mode

Run both the client and server in development mode with live reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the webpack dev server for the client
- Launch the game server with development settings
- Open the game in your default browser (to disable this behavior, set `SKIP_BROWSER_OPEN=true` in your environment)

### Client Only

To run just the client with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run start:client
```

### Server Only

To run just the server with development settings:

```bash
npm run start:server-dev
```

### Connecting to staging or production backends

Sometimes it's useful to connect to production servers when replaying a game, testing user profiles, purchases, or login flow.

> To replay a production game, make sure you're on the same commit that the game you want to replay was executed on, you can find the `gitCommit` value via `https://api.openfront.io/game/[gameId]`.
> Unfinished games cannot be replayed on localhost.

To connect to staging api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:staging
```

To connect to production api servers:

```bash
npm run dev:prod
```

## 🛠️ Development Tools

- **Format code**:

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

- **Lint code**:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Lint and fix code**:

  ```bash
  npm run lint:fix
  ```

- **Testing**
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `/src/client` - Frontend game client
- `/src/core` - Shared game logic

### Project Governance

- The project maintainer ([evan](https://github.com/evanpelle)) has final authority on all code changes and design decisions
- All pull requests require maintainer approval before merging
- The maintainer reserves the right to reject contributions that don't align with the project's vision or quality standards

### Contribution Path for New Contributors

To ensure code quality and project stability, we use a progressive contribution system:

1. **New Contributors**: Limited to UI improvements and small bug fixes only
   - This helps you become familiar with the codebase
   - UI changes are easier to review and less likely to break core functionality
   - Small, focused PRs have a higher chance of being accepted

2. **Established Contributors**: After several successful PRs and demonstrating understanding of the codebase, you may work on more complex features

3. **Core Contributors**: Only those with extensive experience with the project may modify critical game systems

### How to Contribute Successfully

1. **Before Starting Work**:
   - Open an issue describing what you want to contribute
   - Wait for maintainer feedback before investing significant time
   - Small improvements can proceed directly to PR stage

2. **Code Quality Requirements**:
   - All code must be well-commented and follow existing style patterns
   - New features should not break existing functionality
   - Code should be thoroughly tested before submission
   - All code changes in src/core _MUST_ be tested.

3. **Pull Request Process**:
   - Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Describe what testing you've performed
   - Be responsive to feedback and requested changes

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Verify your changes work as expected
   - Test on multiple systems/browsers if applicable
   - Document your testing process in the PR

### Communication

- Be respectful and constructive in all project interactions
- Questions are welcome, but please search existing issues first
- For major changes, discuss in an issue before starting work

### Final Notes

Remember that maintaining this project requires significant effort. The maintainer appreciates your contributions but must prioritize long-term project health and stability. Not all contributions will be accepted, and that's okay.

Thank you for helping make OpenFront better!
